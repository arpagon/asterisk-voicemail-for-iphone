==Install Guide==

Please excuse this sloppy install. Due to popular demand, I am releasing alpha
versions of this software in order to get it cleaned up for a proper release.

== Apache Setup ==

You need to set up a /messages/ Alias for listening to messages
In your apache conf file add:
Alias /messages /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/default

Change apache default user and group to asterisk. For the software to be able to delete and move messages, it must have read/write access to all the asterisk files. This accomplishes that.

For me, /var/lib/php5 needed to be chowned to asterisk for session_start() to work. There may be other folders that need to be chowned to asterisk due to the web server running as asterisk. Check your apache error log for messages.

== Dependency Install ==

* Install Smarty on your web server. This is a PHP template system.
I created a folder named /iphone/ underneath /templates/

* Install Lame on your web server (for mp3 creation)

* Install iUI in a subfolder named 'iui' inside the application folder
I have the iphone app at /iphone/ so iUI is installed at /iphone/iui/

== Install Smarty Templates in smarty templates folder ==

iphone/login.tpl
iphone/main.tpl


==Install files in the application folder==

iphone/delete.php
iphone/i_db.php
iphone/i_functions.php
iphone/i_settings.php
iphone/index.php
iphone/listen.php
iphone/logout.php
iphone/main.js
iphone/main.php
iphone/readme.txt
iphone/install.txt

==Customize i_settings.php==

copy i_settings.php.dist to i_settings.php

You must edit this file with correct paths and options

== All Done!! ==
