Hundreds of downloads of the software, and not a single email requesting for help installing. Can the install instructions be that perfect? Can the software be that good? I really doubt it. Maybe my email is broken or something...

==Install Guide==

Please excuse this sloppy install. Due to popular demand, I am releasing alpha
versions of this software in order to get it cleaned up for a proper release.

== Apache Setup ==

You need to set up a /messages/ Alias for listening to messages
In your apache conf file add:
Alias /messages /var/spool/asterisk/voicemail/default

Change apache default user and group to asterisk. For the software to be able to delete and move messages, it must have read/write access to all the asterisk files. This accomplishes that.

For me, /var/lib/php5 needed to be chowned to asterisk for session_start() to work. There may be other folders that need to be chowned to asterisk due to the web server running as asterisk. Check your apache error log for messages.

== Dependency Install ==

  * Install Smarty on your web server. Debian based systems apt-get install smarty
  * Install Lame on your web server (for mp3 creation). Debian based systems apt-get install lame
  * Install php-curl. Debian based systems apt-get install php5-curl
  * Install iUI in a subfolder named 'iui' inside the application folder. I have the iphone app at /iphone/ so iUI is installed at /iphone/iui/ . iUI can be found here http://code.google.com/p/iui/ . I have a pre-release version of iUI that has MUCH smoother scrolling. Contact me if you need a copy, or just wait for them to update.

== Install Smarty Templates in smarty templates folder ==

  * templates/iphone/login.tpl
  * templates/iphone/main.tpl


==Install files in the application folder==

  * iphone/delete.php
  * iphone/i_db.php
  * iphone/i_functions.php
  * iphone/i_settings.php
  * iphone/index.php
  * iphone/listen.php
  * iphone/logout.php
  * iphone/main.js
  * iphone/main.php
  * iphone/readme.txt
  * iphone/install.txt

==Customize i_settings.php==

copy i_settings.php.dist to i_settings.php

You must edit this file with correct paths and options

== All Done!! ==
