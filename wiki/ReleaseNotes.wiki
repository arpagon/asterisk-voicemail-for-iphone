- Listening to messages is done in an unsecure way. We are adding an apache alias which anyone can go to the URL and listen. Need to write a php page which will perform session/security checks and pass the mp3 sound file through. The iPhone quicktime interface grabs the music in chunks which I am not sure how to handle (sample code in listen.php is a good head start, but it needs to be fixed)
			
- Some MP3s are not playable. For some reason they always have a duration of 10 seconds. I believe this to be a bug with the mp3 generation (sox or lame). This seems to happen maybe once every 10 or 20 messages.
